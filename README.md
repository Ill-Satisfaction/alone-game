# alone-game
This is a repository for a group game/interactive comic for GIMM 250.

## notes from 2021
I do not stand by this code with my current knowledge, but I'll leave the repo public for historic reasons. I think that I did reasonably well given the fact that I did not actually have a Mac to code this on, and had no knowledge of mobile design paradigms at that time. If I were to re-create this storybook, I would (after brushing up on Swift) do it completely differently.


Thanks to Jay Lounge for letting us use their song, "Alone - Jay Lounge"
